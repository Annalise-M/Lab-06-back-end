# Lab-06-back-end

Authors: Annalise Murphy and Max Lamb

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)


## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
* This is a geolocation and weather app that we are developing and maybe in the future we will connect the two.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a developer user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Install all of the appropriate node packages and gather the proper API's needed.
## Architecture
<!-- To the best of your ability, provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. The audience would be a new developer user to the project -->
Languages: Javascript, Node, Trello?

Libraries: Weather API and a Geolocation API

The application receives a request from the user based off of their location and displays the weather within the specified location.
